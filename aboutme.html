<p><div> I attended <a href="https://www.skylinecollege.edu/" target="_blank" style="color:teal;"><strong>Skyline College</strong></a>, where I completed my <strong>A.S.</strong> in <strong>Natural Sciences</strong> in 2012.</div></p>

<p><div> Chris Etienne is a dedicated and enthusiastic Research Scientist with more than seven years of biomedical research experience. I can be found either at the bench, doing "wet lab" experiments or on the computational front, running bioinformatics analysis. </div></p>

<p><div> My goal is to use my dual scientific background with multidisciplinary and innovative approaches to address fundamental questions about the molecular mechanisms of diseases.
Some of my current work is focused on developing novel therapeutics and identify biomarkers that will have the potential of providing better treatment options for patients and advance health care.</div></p>

<p><div> I first started doing research as an undergraduate student, at the <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank" style="color:teal;"><strong>University of California Santa Cruz</strong></a>, where I graduated with a double major in <strong>Chemistry</strong> and <strong>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</strong> in 2015.
At UCSC, I worked in the lab of <a href="http://lokey.chemistry.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank" style="color:teal;"><strong>Dr. Scott Lokey</strong></a> in the <a href="https://www.chemistry.ucsc.edu/index.html" target="_blank" style="color:teal;"><strong>Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry</strong></a>.
The Lokey lab's main areas of focus are the development of new methodologies for synthesizing “natural product-like” cyclic peptides and the membrane permeability of these compounds and other small molecules.</div></p>

<p><div> I completed my <strong>M.Sc.</strong> in <strong>Bioinformatics</strong> in 2018 at Johns Hopkins University.
While pursuing my Masters' degree, I also conducted research in the lab of Dr. <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/0800013/prashant-desai"target="_blank" style="color:teal;"><strong>Prashant Desai</strong></a> at the <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/kimmel_cancer_center/" target="_blank" style="color:teal;"><strong>Sidney Kimmel Cancer Cener</strong></a>, a branch of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
The research focus of the Desai lab is on the molecular mechanisms of viral species known to cause human diseases, specifically herpesviruses.
study the mechanisms of assembly and morphogenesis of herpesvirus capsids and the acquisition of the proteinaceous tegument coat.</div></p>
