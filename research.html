<p><div>I am a dedicated and enthusiastic Research Scientist with more than seven years of Biomedical research experience. I can be found either at the bench, doing "wet lab" experiments or on the computational front, running bioinformatics analysis.</div></p>

<p><div>My goal is to use my dual scientific background with multidisciplinary and innovative approaches to address fundamental questions about the molecular mechanisms of diseases.
Some of my current work is focused on developing novel therapeutics and identify biomarkers that will have the potential of providing better treatment options for patients and advance health care.</div></p>
