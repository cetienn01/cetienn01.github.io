<p><div>My overall goal as a researcher is to help translate our understanding of <strong>Cancer Biology</strong> and <strong>Immunology</strong> to develop personalized therapies and diagnostics to transform clinical practice to benefit patient health.</div></p>

<p><div> As a multi-disciplinary scientist working at the intersection of <strong>Molecular/Cell Biology</strong> and <strong>Data Science</strong>, I am particularly excited and motivated to conduct scientific research and develop computational methods for personalized cancer immunotherapies. To accomplish this, I can be found either at the bench - doing laboratory work, or on the computational front - running bioinformatics analysis.</div></p>

<h3 style="color:Tomato; font-size:150%; text-align:center; font-family:verdana"><strong>Laboratory Activities</strong></h3>
<p><div> In the <strong>wet lab</strong>, I take great pride in conducting innovative research designed to identify and validate immune-based therapies for cancer.  From <strong>experimental design</strong>, to  <strong>assay development</strong>, to <strong>protocol optimization</strong>, to <strong>biological tools generation</strong> and <strong>instrument maintenance</strong>, I use my skills to help advance research platforms and enable my colleagues to do great science.
</div></p>

<h3 style="color:Tomato; font-size:150%; text-align:center; font-family:verdana"><strong>Bioinformatics Work</strong></h3>

<p><div>My activities on the <strong>computational bioloy</strong> side provide me with another set of amazing opportunities. First, I get to <strong>develop computational tools/software and methods</strong> that enable cancer immunotherapy research. I also get to <strong>explore and analyze multi-dimensional data</strong> (clinical and pre-clinical datasets) as part of the broader efforts to study <strong>identify novel targets</strong>, and <strong>characterize the biological mechanisms of action</strong> of novel immunotherapeutic product candidates for the treatment of cancer.</div></p>
